# Restaurant Review on Food Sentiment Analyzer 🍽️

Excited to share my end-to-end NLP & Machine Learning project — Food Review Sentiment Analyzer!

“This project implements an end-to-end NLP food review sentiment analysis system using TF-IDF and Random Forest, with a Streamlit frontend that validates food-related input and explains predictions visually.”

## ==> What it does:
 • Analyzes customer food reviews
 • Predicts whether the sentiment is Positive or Negative
 • Detects food items mentioned in the review
 • Filters out non-food reviews with a clear warning
 • Interactive Streamlit frontend with custom CSS

## ==> Tech Stack & Concepts Used:
 • Natural Language Processing (Text Cleaning, Stemming)
 • TF-IDF Vectorization
 • Random Forest Classifier
 • Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Bias-Variance, ROC-AUC)
 • Pickle (Model Serialization)
 • Streamlit (Frontend & Deployment)

##  
->Used pandas, re, nltk, pickle for data handling, text cleaning, NLP
->Applied text preprocessing: cleaning, lowercasing, tokenization, and stemming
->Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer
->Trained a Random Forest Classifier for sentiment prediction
->Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Bias-Variance, and ROC-AUC

This project strengthened my understanding of ML model building, evaluation, and deployment, and how to convert a notebook model into a real-world application.
